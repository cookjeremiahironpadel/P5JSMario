# Placeholder Assets Instructions

Since the actual image and sound files aren't included in this repository, you can either:

1. Create your own assets with the following names and place them in the `assets` folder:
   - mario.png
   - mario_jump.png
   - ground.png
   - pipe.png
   - cloud.png
   - coin.png
   - goomba.png
   - jump.mp3
   - coin.mp3
   - die.mp3

2. Or use the game without assets - it will automatically use simple colored shapes as fallbacks.

## Suggested Free Resources

You can find Mario-style sprites and sounds on websites like:
- OpenGameArt.org
- Freesound.org
- Pixabay

Make sure to use assets that are free for personal/educational use.

## Alternative: Use Browser's Canvas Drawing

The game is designed to work even without external assets by using p5.js drawing functions to create simple shapes as placeholders.
